# 🚀 rfind
[![CI](https://github.com/daviddl9/rfind/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/daviddl9/rfind/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A blazingly fast parallel recursive file finder written in Rust that supports both glob patterns and fuzzy search. It is a **supercharged** alternative to the classic [\*nix `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) command.

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 Supports both glob patterns (e.g., `*.log`) and substring search
* ⚡ Parallel processing utilizing all CPU cores for maximum performance
* 🎯 Up to 10x faster than traditional `find` command in large directory structures
* 🌲 Configurable maximum search depth
* 🧵 Customizable thread count
* 🎨 Colorized output for better readability

## 💨 Performance

In benchmarks on large directory structures (1M+ files), RFind consistently outperforms the traditional UNIX `find` command:

* 🏃 Directory with 1M files: `find` takes ~45s, RFind completes in ~4s
* 📁 Deep nested structures: Up to 12x performance improvement
* 💾 SSD optimization: Maximizes I/O throughput with parallel workers

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
rfind [OPTIONS] <PATTERN>

Options:
  -d, --dir <DIR>         Starting directory (defaults to current directory)
  -m, --max-depth <DEPTH> Maximum search depth [default: 100]
  -t, --threads <COUNT>   Number of worker threads (defaults to CPU core count)
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

## 📝 Examples

Search for all log files in the current directory:
```bash
rfind "*.log"
```

Find all Python files up to 3 directories deep:
```bash
rfind -m 3 "*.py"
```

Search for files containing "backup" in their name:
```bash
rfind "backup"
```

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
cargo install rfind
```

## ⚡ How It Works

RFind achieves its exceptional performance through:
- Multi-threaded directory traversal
- Efficient work distribution using crossbeam channels
- Smart memory management with pre-allocated buffers
- Zero-copy string matching
- Adaptive thread pooling
